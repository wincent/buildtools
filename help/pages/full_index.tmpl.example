  ## Index items will appear in the order that they are added.
  ## As an alternative to editing this file by hand, there are two helper
  ## scripts that can be run from inside the application help directory:
  ##
  ##    ../../buildtools/help/index_grep.rb:
  ##
  ##          Greps through the help directory looking for suitable
  ##          directives and emits a list of "index_item" links to standard
  ##          out. To be detected the directives should be of the form:
  ##
  ##                #set $page_title = 'Super title'
  ##                #set $tag        = 'super_title'
  ##
  ##          and will yield "index_item" links like:
  ##
  ##                $index_item($link_to('super_title', 'Super title'))
  ##
  ##    ../../buildtools/help/update_full_index.rb:
  ##
  ##          Takes the output of the index_grep.rb script and inserts it into
  ##          the file at page/full_index.tmpl inside the application help
  ##          directory, replacing any existing text between the start and end
  ##          markers

  ## -- index items start -- ##
  $index_item($link_to('a_page', 'text for page link'))
  ## -- index items end -- ##

  #super
