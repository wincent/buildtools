## This file contains default settings which should apply to the entire help book.
## All these settings are compulsory; any unset value will cause an error at runtime.
## Instance variables are used instead of standard placeholders so that we can test for nil.

## This is the localized name of the book.
## Help Viewer does not require spaces to be URL encoded.
## Any characters with special meaning in HTML are automatically converted to HTML entities at runtime.
## Example: 'Hextrapolate Help'
## Example: 'Ayuda de Hextrapolate'
#set $book_id = 'Application Help'

## This is the path to a 16 by 16 icon graphic, beginning with the name of help book folder.
## Help Viewer does require any spaces in the path to be URL encoded, but this is handled automatically at runtime.
## Any characters with special meaning in HTML are automatically converted to HTML entities at runtime.
## Example: 'Hextrapolate Help/gfx/icon16.png' (automatically converted at runtime to 'Hextrapolate%20Help/gfx/icon16.png')
#set $book_icon = 'Application Help/gfx/icon16.png'

## This is the page title.
## An application-wide default should be set, and each page should override it with a more specific title.
## Help Viewer does not require spaces to be URL encoded.
## Any characters with special meaning in HTML are automatically converted to HTML entities at runtime.
## Note that for convenience a "set_page_title" method is provided so that per-page titles can be set using conventional placeholder syntax
## (no need to directly manipulate instance variables).
## Example: 'Hextrapolate Help' (application-wide default)
## Example: 'Getting started with Hextrapolate' (page-specific override)
#set $page_title = 'Application Help'
